        Stainless Steel 303
        Stainless steel type 1.4305 is popularly known as grade 303 stainless steel. It is the most readily machinable of all the austenitic grades of stainless steel

        Key Features
        Highly machinable

        Applications of 303
        Typically used in heavily machinable parts:

        Nuts and Bolts
        Screws
        Gears
        Aircraft fittings
        Bushings
        Shafts

        Phosphorous (P) - 		0.0 - 0.05
        Iron (Fe) -			Balance

        Weldability
        The sulphur addition present in 303 stainless steel results in poor weldability. If 303 must be welded the recommended filler rods or electrodes are grades 308L and 309 stainless steels. For maximum corrosion resistance, the welds must be annealed.

        Corrosion Resistance
        Sulphur additions to the composition act as initiation sites for pitting corrosion. This decreases the corrosion resistance of 303 stainless steel to less than that for 304. However. corrosion resistance remains good in mild environments.

        In chloride containing environments over 60°C, 303 stainless steel is subject to pitting and crevice corrosion. Grade 303 stainless is not suitable for use in marine environments.

        Brass CZ121
        Brasses are alloys of Copper and Zinc. They may also contain small amounts of other alloying elements to impart advantageous properties. Brasses have high corrosion resistance and high tensile strength. They are also suited to fabrication by hot forging. Free machining grades of brass set the standard for machining, by which other metals are compared. Brasses are divided into two classes. The alpha alloys, with less than 37% Zinc, and the alpha/beta alloys with 37-45% Zinc. Alpha alloys are ductile and can be cold worked. Alpha/beta or duplex alloys have limited cold ductility and are harder and stronger. CZ121 / CW614N is an alpha/beta alloy. Brass alloy CZ121 / CW614N is used for machining. It has Lead added to the composition to improve machinability. The Lead remains insoluble in the microstructure of the brass and the soft particles act as chip breakers.

        Applications of CZ121
        High spee machined components
        Architectural extrusions
        Locks
        Hinges
